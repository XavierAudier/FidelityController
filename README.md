This repository is used to control remotely a Coherent Fidelity laser system. 

The code implies that the fidelity software is running on the computer, and that remote control is enabled.
This repository provides a simple class that can be added to use the Fidelity as part of a bigger data acquisition software.

- controller.fidelity.py  contains the base class to interface the Fidelity Laser using remote control.
- ui.mainwindow.ui    is currently unused, but could be made into a graphical interface.

**Feel free to contribute to this repository.**
